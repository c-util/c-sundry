 * Atomic Reference Counter
 *
 * This implements an atomic reference counter. That is, references can be
 * acquired and released from multiple threads in parallel.
 *
 * To use CRef, an object needs a member of type `_Atomic unsigned long', which
 * counts the references. All functions here take it as first argument and only
 * operate on this one field.
